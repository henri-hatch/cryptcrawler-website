<h1>CryptCrawler v5 Handbook</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1: Getting Started</h2>

<p>CryptCrawler v5 is a fantasy role-playing game in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> tradition: you play heroes hunting monsters, chasing treasure, and making a story together.</p>

<p>You can try anything. When the outcome is uncertain (or the consequences matter), the Storyteller (ST) calls for a <strong>test</strong>. Roll <strong>2d6</strong>, add the relevant modifiers, and resolve the result together.</p>

<h3>Ability scores</h3>

<p>Every character has six ability scores. They describe what you're naturally good at and what kinds of problems you tend to solve.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Might (MIG):</strong> Strength, stamina, and athleticism—lifting, climbing, grappling, forcing doors.</li>
<li><strong>Finesse (FIN):</strong> Speed and agility—stealth, acrobatics, quick hands, precise strikes.</li>
<li><strong>Fortitude (FOR):</strong> Endurance and grit—resisting poison, surviving harsh environments, pushing through fear and pain.</li>
<li><strong>Presence (PRE):</strong> Force of personality—charming, intimidating, deceiving, leading.</li>
<li><strong>Intuition (INT):</strong> Experience and instincts—tracking, spotting details, reading people, sensing danger.</li>
<li><strong>Reason (REA):</strong> Logic and knowledge—history, lore, identifying oddities, solving puzzles.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>Sometimes a test clearly lines up with one of your skills. If you think a skill applies, ask the ST to add your <strong>skill bonus</strong> to the roll. If the ST agrees, add that bonus.</p>

<p>In a <strong>skill test</strong> (a test that explicitly calls out a specific skill), you only add the core ability score and that one skill—no piling on other skill bonuses.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Climbing a jungle vine quickly might be an <strong>Athletics</strong> skill test. Roll for <strong>MIG</strong> and add your Athletics bonus (if you have it). You can't add Acrobatics or Fortitude on top.</p>

<h3>Reading the dice</h3>

<p>Use this table for the narrative outcome of a test:</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Character Creation</h2>

<h3>Ability scores</h3>

<p>Assign the following modifiers across your six abilities: <strong>+3, +2, +1, +1, +0, -1</strong>.<br />
This defines what your character is naturally great at—and where they're vulnerable.</p>

<h3>Titles</h3>

<p><strong>Titles</strong> are lasting traits that reflect your character's actions, reputation, or history. A title is a passive rule that changes how you play. Titles can be helpful, harmful, or both, and they can evolve over time.</p>

<h3>Ancestry</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>No racial ability score modifiers. No alignment tendencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Ancestries to give unique maneuvers which encourage a specific playstyle.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Human (Sense undead, +1 to anything, <em>human determination or</em> <em>1 ancestral ability</em>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Any skill.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Elf (Darkvision 60ft, immunity to poison, disease, and sleep, <em>1 subrace ability</em>)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Moon elves (misty step), sun elves, high elves (magic cantrip), wood elves (meld into wilderness).</p></li>
<li><p>Nature, spellcraft, survival.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dwarf (Darkvision 60ft, bonus action dash at enemy, +2 HP per level, immunity fear)</p>

<ul>
<li>Athletics, crafting, history.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Draeling (Darkvision 60ft, resistance against fire, immune to charm, COMMAND)</p></li>
<li><p>Hartkin (Reroll critical fails, +5 damage against big foes, hartkin can't lie to each other, immune to difficult terrain)</p>

<ul>
<li>Persuasion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dragonborn (Elemental breath, elemental resistance, claw attacks)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Origin</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Specific titles based on backstory or character flavor that usually gives you a positive and negative trait</p></li>
<li><p>Take 1 with your character on creation</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Starting outfit and equipment</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Choose an outfit to determine your starting equipment:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adventurer Outfit</strong> (201 marc)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Anti-toxin (15), Backpack (30), 20 Caltrops (6), Dagger (8), Fishing rod (8), Flint &amp; steel (3), Lyre (13), Net (8), 10ft pole (5), 50ft rope (8), Ringmail (50) 2-person tent (25), Waterskin (2).</p></li>
<li><p>5 days rations (15), 5 marc</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Thief Outfit</strong> (201 marc)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Backpack (30), 1,000 Ball Bearings (3), Blowgun (3), 50 blowgun needles (5), Comb (2), Disguise kit (40), Leather armor (40), 50-ft rope (5), Thieves' tools (30), Waterskin (2).</p></li>
<li><p>5 days rations (15), 25 marc</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Make Your Own</strong> (200 marc)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Skills and mastery</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Start with two skills: One of anything and one from your <em>ancestral pool</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>How to make skills more tightly to your character identity.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Skill maneuvers are separated into rows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rows unlocked via having at least 3 in the previous row.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Skills should give you supernatural abilities. VERY ANIME.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Capstone abilities? Picking capstone ability means you lock yourself out of the other capstone abilities. MASTERY.</p></li>
<li><p>Each MASTERY gives you an increase to its base ability score (this replaced ability score improvements and feats).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Codices (classes)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Start classless (a hero!)</p></li>
<li><p>All codices are a new skill tree that can be unlocked by fulfilling its set of skill requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Each codex follows the same requirement template: 2 mastered skills (typically related to what the codex does), a secondary skill at least started, and finally a lore requirement. This lore requirement can be anything from an ancestry requirement, an alignment requirement, or even a literal action taken in game. This usually looks like you unlocking your codex of choice around level 25.</p></li>
<li><p>Each codex has 5 tiers. You may only take one maneuver from each tier and then progress to the next tier. Once all 5 tiers are unlocked, you may unlock the codex mastery which usually takes shape in the form of an incredibly strong passive or an ultimate ability.</p></li>
<li><p>All codices can be leveled normally with 2 EXP per tier (the first one is free just by unlocking the codex) for a total of 10 EXP.</p></li>
<li><p>A codex is not required. You could totally meet the requirements of something just to ignore it and move on. Maybe you want to be a simple stat stick, relying on nothing but your good ol' skills without any specialization. Or even, just dumping all of your EXP into ability score improvements to be the perfect individual.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Leveling and EXP</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>At the end of an encounter, gain X amount of EXP (where X is weighted by the DM in difficulty. See chart)</p></li>
<li><p>During a long rest, spend EXP to gain levels in skills. Your total level is equal to the sum of each skill level. All skills require 1exp to progress.</p></li>
<li><p>You can spend exp on personal projects during a long rest such as building or tinkering with weapons, creating items, constructing buildings, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>On level up, gain HP equal to 1d4 + FOR.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<ul>
<li>Gain projects through skill trees/learning in character.</li>
<li>Each project has a time and exp requirement where time is the number of long rests and exp is simply the amount of exp to complete it.
<ul>
<li>Projects help the player mechanically, not just rp.</li>

<h2>Chapter 3: Skill Tests</h2>

<p>In CC v5 there are two kinds of skill tests (previously known as skill checks). The first is your typical out-of-combat check. This is made with 2d6 plus any modifier you have to the requested check. The table looks like this:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Total (2d6 + modifiers)</th>
  <th>Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>≤ 6</td>
  <td><strong>Failure</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>7-10</td>
  <td><strong>Success, however…</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>≥ 11</td>
  <td><strong>Success</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>6-6</td>
  <td><strong>Success, and…</strong> <em>(Boxcars)</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1-1</td>
  <td><strong>Failure, and…</strong> <em>(Snake Eyes)</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The second kind of skill test is one done during combat. Most of the time these will look like one of your stats versus the listed stat (whether that be an aggressor's SPELL modifier or a flat number. These are always in the following format:</p>

<p><strong>[MIG &lt; Your SPELL] OR [MIG &lt; 3]</strong></p>

<p>The stat being tested by the target is on the left and the comparison from the origin is on the right with what needs to be met being in the middle. For instance, in the first example, the aggressor will succeed if their SPELL modifier is greater than the target's MIG attribute.</p>

<p>For any of these skill tests, you may argue to the ST (Storyteller) that one of your skills may be able to replace your attribute due to it being applicable. The modifier of the skill bonus is dependent on the tier of the skill you have unlocked from +1 to +4 (mastered). For instance, you may be having to perform a MIG check to avoid being grappled, but in character you have a -1 to MIG. You then argue to the ST that you should be able to use your mastered Negotiation skill by talking the aggressor out of grappling you and replacing your -1 MIG attribute score with a +4 Negotiation skill score. If by some miracle the ST allows this, you may continue with the +4 modifier instead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: Combat</h2>

<h3>Initiative</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Combat starts by rolling initiative. Initiative determines turn order throughout combat. Initiative is split up between the party, and the enemies. Take turns between the party and the enemies choosing which player (who hasn't gone yet that round) should go next until all players have had one turn. The team whose player had the highest initiative roll among all creatures in combat goes first.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your initiative is equal to your FIN.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Turns and action economy</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>During each turn of combat, a creature has an action, bonus action, movement, and a reaction.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An action is what your character spends the majority of their turn doing such as attacking with a weapon, casting a spell, or drinking a potion.</p></li>
<li><p>A bonus action is a secondary maneuver which your character can perform off-handedly without disrupting your action. Examples for a bonus action include, swinging a weapon in your offhand or pulling a small item from your pocket.</p></li>
<li><p>Movement refers to your character moving throughout the battlefield. Occasionally your movement may be used in a maneuver. Your movement speed is different based on your <em>Ancestry</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reactions can only be used on another creature's turn, and often involve you intervening to interrupt or aid another creature's action. Examples for a reaction include, countering a spell, granting a small bonus to a skill check, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Maneuvers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>You spend your action and bonus action performing different maneuvers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A maneuver is a unique ability which your character can perform. Each maneuver has a use limit: some can only be used once a day, some once an encounter, and some on command.</p></li>
<li><p>You can only use a maneuver you have equipped. You can choose to equip and unequip maneuver when you take a long rest. Each character can only have a maximum of ten maneuvers equipped at a time.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You spend your movement on your turn moving up to your maximum movement.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Hit points, wounds, and soul scars</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your health points (or HP) is a measurement of your physical wellbeing. When your HP is reduced to below half its maximum, you are considered desperate. When your HP is reduced to zero, you are dying. Whenever you suffer damage while dying you gain a <em>wound</em>: a grievous injury which cannot be healed under normal circumstances. Accumulating three <em>wounds</em> kills your character. If you are resurrected after dying, you suffer a soul scar. While these do nothing on their own, lots of maneuvers gain increased difficulty on creatures with soul scars such as healing spells, further resurrections, etc. In RP, every additional soul scar begins to leave physical marks on your body as your body  becomes more and more hastily rebuilt.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Threshold checks during combat</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some effects may cause you to test a skill. For instance, a fireball might have you “[FIN > 2] The hit creature takes half damage.” meaning to pass the check, you must have a FIN score of higher than 2 to take half damage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Damage, armor points, and damage types</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Whenever you suffer damage, subtract it from your AP first and then your total HP.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are ten types of damage: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, void, psychic, radiant, thunder, and physical. Some damage types have particular properties.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lightning damage cannot be dodged.</p></li>
<li><p>Acid damage cannot be blocked.</p></li>
<li><p>Psychic damage cannot be blocked or dodged and goes through armor BUT applies levels of strain onto your character.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Defenses: block and dodge</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>There are two types of defense, block and dodge. Block is meant to mitigate a certain amount of the damage but not all of it whereas dodge presents a chance to dodge all of it or take all of the damage on a fail. Add a new dice to the total every 10 levels. Light armor cannot gain block and starts with 2d12 dodge, heavy armor cannot gain dodge and starts with 2d4 block, and medium armor starts with 1d12 dodge and 1d4 block.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dodge dice are always d12</p></li>
<li><p>Block dice are always d4</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ranged weapon tags</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Ranged weapons have different rules.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Weapons with the 'Reload N' tag can be fired N amount of times before a bonus action must be spent to reload it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bows do not have the reload tag.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Weapons with the 'Jam' tag can jam if you roll a 1 on your crit dice. A jammed weapon can't be fired until it is reloaded again.</p></li>
<li><p>Ranged weapons with the 'Tactical' tag don't have a penalty when using it in close range.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 5: Resting and Recovery</h2>

<p>After your character becomes inevitably exhausted, you may wish to rest for a while to regain hit points, mend armor to regain AP, etc. There are two forms of rest:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Short Rest</strong>: A smaller rest lasting a night, a place to lie your head down quickly before continuing your adventure. This gives you the following benefits:
<ol>
<li>You may change out your equipped maneuvers for others you have learned.</li>
<li>Any existing exhaustion points are removed.</li>
<li>Heal half of your maximum HP pool.</li>
<li>Perform any necessary tasks to restore your AP.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Long Rest</strong>: A longer rest lasting at least a week. You must be in a safe spot for this to occur. Gain the following benefits:
<ol>
<li>Fully heal your HP.</li>
<li>Fully restore your AP.</li>
<li>All of the short rest benefits.</li>
</ol></li>

<h2>Chapter 7: Conditions</h2>

<p>Conditions are a way for the game to describe a character in a temporary state. A creature without conditions is their “default.” As adventurers fight, hide, sleep, and quest they will enter in and out of many conditions. There are negative conditions (such as exhaustion, blindness, burning), and positive conditions (hiding, light-footed, energetic).</p>

<p>Some conditions can grow or diminish in strength. This is represented with condition stacks. Whenever the condition would be given to a creature again, it is instead added as a stack. Stackable conditions increase in potency depending on how many stacks there are on a creature. A creature with a stack of poison will only take 1 acid damage per turn, while a creature with seven stacks of poison will suffer 7 acid damage per turn. At the end of a creature's turn, they remove one stack from all stackable conditions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8: Economy</h2>

<h3>New Currency!</h3>

<ul>
<li>A player's total currency combined together into a single value: <em>marcs</em>. A marc is similar to a dollar. If you have $23 dollars, that doesn't mean you have twenty-three one dollar bills in your pocket.
<ul>
<li>A player's marc value isn't directly correlated to what their character has in their coinpurse, only the total sum.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You don't have to track how many of each coin you have. Counting spare change isn't cool. Even Tolkien doesn't have scenes describing the conversion rates of Gondorian gold to Morian mithril coins. Just have it as a single number which people add or subtract to.</li>
<li>All coins are called marcs now. We have gold marcs, silver marcs, copper marcs, etc. If a player finds a chest filled with marcs, you don't need to describe how many silver marcs, or gold marcs are in it, only the sum total.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What About the Old Currency?</h3>

<ul>
<li>In lore, Diacles absolutely destroyed the Trans-Endalian economy by pumping it full of dragon gold. The House of Gold (those Marcadian kolbolds) was called in by Emperor Periclitus, and made the new Marcadian currency system (marcs).</li>
<li>Marcs still carry the same tiers of currency as the old system, only now the copper coin is the standard unit rather than the gold coin. Here's a chart to compare to.</li>
</ul>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Marcadian Coin</th>
  <th>Value (Marcs)</th>
  <th>Endalian Coin</th>

</tbody>
</table>

<ul>
<li>Isn't that so nice and orderly?
<ul>
<li><em>Everyone stood up and clapped at the new economic system.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Pricing &amp; Pay</h3>

<ul>
<li>Last D\&amp;D campaign the pricing and economy wasn't very well thought out (my bad). This resulted in herculean prices for things, like 8,000 gold for a +1 sword. We intend to fix that with this simple rule.
<ul>
<li><strong>10 marcs is a day's wage (aka 1 silver)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>100 marcs is 10 days wages (aka 1 gold)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>1,000 marcs is 100 days wages (aka 1 platinum)</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Food, mundane common items, should not cost a day's wages. This goes without saying. The majority of common items cost less than 10 marcs.</li>
<li>This also means that platinum coins are basically unheard of among the common people. Platinum coins are unique to the super rich, and are exchanged among noblemen and elite merchants.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 9: Downtime Projects</h2>

<h3>What is a Project?</h3>

<ul>
<li>A project is something that a character dedicates their downtime towards completing.
<ul>
<li><strong>Making an Item.</strong> The most common form of this is crafting an item. This can range from crafting mundane items (such as a ranger fletching arrows) to crafting complex or magical items.</li>
<li><strong>Training.</strong> Some creatures spend their downtime continuing to hone their skills, sharpening their martial prowess.</li>
<li><strong>Research.</strong> More mentally inclined characters may spend their downtime reading or researching a particular topic (including learning a language).</li>
<li><strong>Building a Structure.</strong> While not on the road, creatures can build structures or buildings which grant them bonuses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Projects should require a skill test from the character.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mechanics of a Project</h3>

<ul>
<li>A project is a maneuver (technically) which you use during a long or short rest to make something.
<ul>
<li>Spending your rest on a project means you must pass a test (listed on the project) to make any progress. When you reach the final stage of the project, you get the listed result.</li>
<li>Failing a test, you may choose to spend all night trying again, skipping the benefits of a rest to try again.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Projects can be equipped and like maneuvers. Unequipping a project means you lose any progress on that project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 10: Crafting and Materials</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Particularly creative and inventive characters can build structures, forge weapons, and enchant items.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>

<p>Rather than having a laundry list of specific items and their corresponding effects while crafting, CryptCrawler uses a material system. Crafting ingredients fall into various categories called material types. All crafting items, from common weeds you may find on the side of a road, to the scale of a red dragon have a material type. Rather than needing specific ingredients (which can still occur, see unique materials) to create a working clock, a GM can set it to be a red and a blue material. A rare item may count as multiple materials (the heart of a fire elemental could be worth three red materials rather than just one for example).</p>

<h4>Making a Magic Item</h4>

<p>Some characters do not wish to follow a recipe given to them, but want to forge a magical item unique to them. To do this, a player takes a non-magical item and combines with a material of their choice, rolling the appropriate dice and following that material's effect chart. This is a laborious process, done during a long rest, with access to other mundane materials the character may need to craft such an item.</p>

<h4>Red Material</h4>

<p>A red material is something that carries an aggressive, elemental, or offensive aura to the item. Red material tends to appear more in components which embody strife or conflict. Common examples of red material would be brimstone, ruby, or a branch from a lightning struck tree. More uncommon examples of red material would be blood of an extraplanar being, glass formed from dragonbreath, or an ingot of mithril. Red materials are often only used to create magical weapons. Using red material to craft a magic item can create the following effects:</p>

<h4>Blue Material</h4>

<p>A blue material is something that carries a fortifying, regenerative, or defensive aura to the item. Blue material tends to appear more in components which embody security and restraint. Examples of blue material would be a gemstone from another plane, a page from the prayerbook of a dead saint, or a bead of adamantine. Blue materials are often only used to create magical armor/trinkets. Using blue material to craft a magic item can create the following effects:</p>
