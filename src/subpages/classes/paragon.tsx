            <h2>Paragon</h2>

            <div>
            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>A Paragon is a warrior of deep conviction, bound by and powered by a magical oath. To be an oathkeeper, you must meet the following prerequisites.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A duty that you don't have the power to fulfill.</li>
                <li>Have a personal code of conduct, with a clear sense of right and wrong.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3>Breakthrough</h3>
            <p>As a Paragon, <em>breakthrough</em> opportunities often involve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Swearing an oath.</li>
                <li>Seeing your view of the world directly challenged.</li>
                <li>Keeping a promise, even if it does not benefit you.</li>
                <li>Failing to keep a promise you made (perhaps one made to yourself).</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3><u>Health</u></h3>
            <p>At 1st level, your DHP and your SHP is 10 + your WIL. Each time you level-up, your SHP increases by 5 + your WIL.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3><u>1st Level: Conviction</u></h3>
            <p>As you are tested, your belief and conviction in your oath only grows. You have a heroic resource called conviction, which you can spend to activate your powerful abilities. Outside of combat, you have conviction equal to your CHA score. If you lose some or all of your conviction outside of combat, it takes 10 minutes to regain it. At the start of your turn, you gain 2 convicition. If you are <u>bloodied</u>, you gain 3 conviction at the start of your turn. All unspent conviction disappears at the end of an encounter.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3><u>1st Level: Righteous Smite</u></h3>
            <p>Fueled by your conviction you reign down righteous judgement on your foes. You gain the <em>Righteous Smite</em> maneuver.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
            <h3><u>1st Level: Sense Intent</u></h3>
            <p>With your dedication to your pledge, you can sense the intent of others. You gain the <em>Sense Intent</em> maneuver.</p>
            </div>
