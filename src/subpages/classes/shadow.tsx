            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>A shadow is the big bump in the night, an urban legend whispered about in small circles. To be a creature of the night, you must meet the following prerequisites.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must have a DEX score of 3 or higher.</li>
                <li>You must have the <em>intimidation</em>, <em>investigation</em>, or <em>light armor</em> skill.</li>
                <li>You must have also the <em>acrobatics</em>, <em>lockpicking</em>, <em>pickpocketing</em>, or <em>stealth</em> skill.</li>

            <div>
            <h3><u>1st Level: Insight</u></h3>
            <p>As you lurk on the perimeter, you gather information which you can exploit. You have a heroic resource called insight, which you can spend to activate your powerful abilities. Outside of combat, you have insight equal to your DEX score. If you lose some or all of your insight outside of combat, it takes 10 minutes to regain it. In combat, at the start of your turn, you gain 2 insight. Whenever you hit a creature with a critical hit, you gain 1 insight. All unspent insight disappears at the end of an encounter.</p>
