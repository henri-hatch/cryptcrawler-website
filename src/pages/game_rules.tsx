      <h3>Core Rules</h3>
      <h4>Ability Checks</h4>
      <p>Roll a d20 and add your ability modifier. If you're proficient in a skill related to the check, 
      add your proficiency bonus as well.</p>
      
      <h4>Combat</h4>
      <p>Combat proceeds in rounds, with each character taking a turn based on initiative order. 
      On your turn, you can move and take one action.</p>
      
      <h4>Magic</h4>
      <p>Spellcasters use spell slots to cast their prepared spells. Different classes access different spell lists 
      and use different methods to cast their magic.</p>
      
      <h4>Resting</h4>
      <p>Characters can take short rests (1 hour) to recover some resources and hit points, 
      or long rests (8 hours) to fully recover.</p>
    </>
